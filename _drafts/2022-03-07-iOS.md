This post is written with the assumption that the reader has practically no knowledge in OS, Jailbreak, iOS. I will try to explain everything as easily as possible contact me via my <a href="https://twitter.com/K0stad1n1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer me"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a>. 

## **Introduction**:
## ðŸ¤” What's an iOS Jailbreak ?
A jailbreak, is a way to use existing security flaws in the iOS operating system, to exploit them and find a way to install a third party app store called Cydia or Sileo (there are many) that enables you to modify the behavior/look and feel of your iPhone/iPad by installing what are called "tweaks". 

Here's an example:

<br> Tweak made by <a href="https://twitter.com/xerusdesign" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer me"><span class="label">Xerus</span></a> called Felicity pro that changes the looks of your icons. 

## **Steps to a jailbreak:**

- Gaining root access to the device
- Bypassing security measures
- Installing the actual third party app store

## Gaining root access to the device:
In OS, the root user is like the Administrator user in Windows 10 or OSX. It has the ability to do anything on the device literally **âœ¨anythingâœ¨**. So to get Administrator privileges in iOS, you need to exploit security flaws in the system to elevate your privileges from the user mobile to root. This type of exploit is called an LPE("Local Privilege Escalation") Local as in on-device, they are reported in the Apple Security Report (that is published at each update).

Here's an example of an LPE reported in the Apple Security Report of iOS 14.8:
